Knowledge Is Everything - that\u2019s a slogan that lots of business domains is catching up right now. On the other hand, recent trends in software development are shifting into micro services environments where loosely coupled, standalone and independent services provide access to various business assets.  With that in mind, knowledge driven micro service idea came into live to combine couple of great technologies together to satisfy such needs: - vert.x - toolkit for building reactive applications on JVM - jBPM and Drools flexible process and rule engines that provide excellent execution environment for business assets - the knowledge - hazelcast - in memory data grid - various programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Scala, Groovy) to attract various development teams  This session is about illustrating how easily and fast you can build knowledge driven micro services and scale them to almost no limits. All in reactive and polyglot fashion with powerful clustering. Scale individual knowledge micro services without a hassle and allow various languages to easily interact with business knowledge without a need to know where they are located. It all goes via clustered event bus provided by Vert.x, backed by deployable knowledge archives provided by jBPM and Drools, clustering delivered by hazelcast data grid and allow polyglot client side access.  It\u2019s all about business knowledge that can be delivered as software solution with: - flexibility - speed of development - isolated scalability - manageability   Come and see how to transform your IT solutions into knowledge driven micro services with Vert.x, jBPM, Drools and Hazelcast.

What about running 'sudo yum update' on your cloud? This is a talk about the work we recently did on updates in TripleO. We start with an existing deployed OpenStack cloud, with 3 controller nodes in HA configuration and running tenant VMs. Each of the nodes that make up the cloud deployment need to be updated, without disruption to the tenants. Ultimately, the goal is that the cloud administrator, from a 'Director' node can do something like:  openstack overcloud update stack overcloud -i --templates ... params  This will update each node in sequence, bringing services down, updating packages and then bringing services back up again. For controller nodes in particular this is more complicated because we need to deal with the Pacemaker cluster, ensuring the wanted changes of the cluster configuration are in place for it to behave as expected during the update and also ensuring that the cloud services remain available.  This talk will at a high level introduce some of the tooling we rely on to achieve this goal and also highlight some of the issues we faced.

However, while working with microservice-based systems, it often appears that a practical mechanism that would provide help in shaping and describing REST contracts would come in handy.   Similarly, creating integration and acceptance tests in such systems presents many challenges. On one hand, we want to make the development and deployment of each service independent and agile, so we tend to use stubs, on the other hand, if we are not able to carry out proper E2E tests, we want to make sure that at any point in time, our stubs are in keeping with how are server actually responds to any given request.  In this talk, I will present Accurest, a tool that allows for both: easily shaping REST contracts and verifying if our app adheres to them. I will show how, using Accurest, we can quickly generate automatically-tested stubs from simple groovy DSL scripts. I will talk about the typical usages and script examples, as well as possible problems and ways of handling them.","tags":["Quality Assurance"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"294"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454751600,"event_start_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 10:40:00 +0100","event_end":1454757000,"event_end_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 12:10:00 +0100","room":"workshops A112 (64 places)","room_short":"A112","room_color":"#ffff00","topic":"Identity-Management with FreeIPA (2nd part)","speakers":["Thorsten Scherf"],"description":"The workshop will give a general introduction into the FreeIPA framework and how it can be used to setup a central authentication solution based on OpenSource tools.

It can easily manage downstream patches and even rebase package distgit[3] to new upstream release. It also contains utilities for managing python requirements.txt files and much more we need to package OpenStack into RDO\/Fedora.  This workshop is for RPM packagers. If you maintain an RPM package that carries some patches, rdopkg will probably save you a lots of time and pain. I'll show you what conventions you need to follow in your dist-git and howto setup your repo[4] in order for rdopkg to work.  I'll demonstrate basic packaging tasks with rdopkg, especially managing patches and rebasing a package to a new upstream version. I'll provide real life examples of rdopkg-managed packages from RDO.

A live migration keeps the guest running on the source host and begins moving the memory without stopping the guest. All modied memory pages are monitored for changes and sent to the destination while the image is sent. The memory is updated with the changed pages. The process continues until the amount of pause time allowed for the guest equals the predicted time for the nal few pages to be transferred. A problem with pre-copy live migration is that depending on the access pattern in the guest system, the migration pro- cess might be unable to reduce the number of dirty pages below the number necessary for the congured pause time to be met. This presentation analyzes the optimal pattern to copy memory assuming the guest access pattern is cyclic and known in advance.","tags":["Virtualization"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"312"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454766600,"event_start_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 14:50:00 +0100","event_end":1454769000,"event_end_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 15:30:00 +0100","room":"a.

Let&rsquo;s assume our language design is awesome and focus on how to make it fast.

We'll look at the key technologies making this possible: the Graal compiler and the Truffle framework. Graal is a modern, dynamic, clean, JIT compiler with aggressive speculative optimizations.

What if I tell you there's a language that combines the best of both worlds: static and dynamic typing? This language offers ease of writing code, with advanced features such as a very efficient garbage collector and support for highly-scalable software architecture, just to name a few. Have you ever wondered what all the fuss is about Go? Why top companies such as Google, Red Hat, Docker, and CoreOS, just to name a few, have chosen to develop their products (Kubernetes, OpenShift, etc.) in Go? If you answered yes to at least one of those questions, this presentation is for you. I'm going to share my experience from transitioning from a long-time Java developer to a Go-dev in mere days. That\u2019s all the effort it took to feel comfortable in the extensive ecosystem surrounding the Go language (also known as \u201cGo-land\u201d).

An OpenStack environment is challenging to debug as is -- more so when multiple Compute nodes and thereby multiple libvirt daemons and QEMU instances are involved. A good grasp of Virtualization debugging mechanisms is vital for effective root cause analysis. To that end, libvirt and QEMU provide a rich set of debugging controls that allow us to query (or modify) the state of virtual machines in distress.  This talk focuses on providing an in-depth view of aforementioned techniques.  Topics include: debugging Nova Compute process crashes; gathering specific patterns from libvirt log filters, libvirt environment variables, and systemd journal fields; live querying the VM (and QEMU) state through `virsh` and QEMU Machine Protocol (QMP) commands; tuning the libvirt daemon logging; monitoring events emitted by QEMU, etc. Along with a real-world example that ties together some of the techniques discussed.  Audience would include OpenStack infrastructure operators, Virtualization (libvirt\/QEMU\/KVM) administrators, developers, tinkerers, or any one interested in understanding the Virtualization layer in OpenStack to help equip yourself with better debugging techniques.","tags":["Virtualization"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"295"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454775600,"event_start_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 17:20:00 +0100","event_end":1454778000,"event_end_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 18:00:00 +0100","room":"a.

These tools have been very effective in traditional networks. But running an IDS \"as-a-service\" in OpenStack is a relatively unexplored topic and interesting questions arise:    --How does one configure an IDS within a software defined network (SDN)? What challenges do a SDN present?  --Do popular open source systems like Snort or Bro scale when monitoring many virtual machiness?   --And what happens to the hypervisor's performance when an IDS is busy monitoring logs and traffic?  This talk will discuss current work that engages these questions. In this instance, the IDS is run on a separate machine than the hypervisor, so processing network traffic does not degrade performance. We will show the virtual network that accomplishes this and point to future directions.

Despite the fact that it has to follow Windows as the reference implementation of all these protocols, Samba was able to substantially raise the bar: Long before Microsoft announced SMB file server cluster with SMB 3.0 in late 2012, Samba created an all-active scale-out file server cluster when running on top of a distributed \/ clustered file system with the introduction of the CTDB software.  While CTDB is at its core a special purpose clustered database and messaging transport for Samba, it is also a slim little resource manager for virtual IPs and a few other services in the cluster.  This presentation describes the architecture of Samba and the history of the creation of CTDB. It demonstrates how easy one can set up a scale out Samba cluster on top of a distributed scale-out file system with the example of GlusterFS, and illustrates a few of the pleasantries that the SMB protocol brings with it in the clustered environment, such as fail over without aborting I\/O by virtue of durable\/persistent file handles.

It is very easy to work with such applications because they know exactly what we need them for and no more. In contrast there exist complex robust applications which can do everything we can think of but they are hard to learn, slow, not effective for our particular need, using too much resources, \"expensive\", and so on. Into this category we can put most of the business applications from big vendors which attract as many customers as possible and which need to fit to any business.  For many years, we have had flexible solutions (SOA, BPM, microservices, etc.) to keep business logic out of our applications. However, we did not have anything like that in the presentation layer and user interfaces of web applications until recently when web components emerged, html5 imports functionality was introduced, and lastly when Polymer 1.x became production ready in May 2015.  In this talk, we will get familiar with Polymer and its elements. To assemble a business application, we will create reusable custom BPM elements which will communicate to KIE Server working as a BPM back-end where we will keep all business processes, rules, forms, and other assets. Since we won't have to pay attention to the business logic, we will use the given time to focus on the user interface which end-users value the most. Like in any web application we will need routing, forms, data binding, signaling, asynchronous calls, calling REST services, hence there are many functionalities to discover.","tags":["Development"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"351"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454838000,"event_start_rfc":"Sun, 07 Feb 2016 10:40:00 +0100","event_end":1454840400,"event_end_rfc":"Sun, 07 Feb 2016 11:20:00 +0100","room":"d.

How do they get more relevant to the new power brokers?  Over the years, application and web developers have made it clear they are uninterested in packaging their applications if it requires them to do things beyond their normal languages and tool-chains. They are also not particularly interested in consuming their dependencies via distribution packaging tools if it requires a lag in availability, the developers packaging the libraries, and\/or learning the packaging software tools beyond the most rudimentary level. Developers have also made it clear that the way software is packaged, normally targeted at production installations, is very cumbersome when using it for development (e.g. the perennial 'setenforce 0').  Many people interpret the above as \"developers don't care about security or the trustworthiness of their dependencies.\" However, this is a mistake. Developers do not ever want to be the person listed as the problem when a major breach occurs. On the flip side, their \"bosses\" (actual bosses, software communities, professors, etc) set and enforce deadlines that do not allow for the time to muck about with things not directly related to their application development.   What can distributions do? Well, how about they stop providing a distribution. Instead, they can provide an operating system and a set of content. Where the \"things\" found in the operating system part are packaged in the traditional manner and provide all the traditional guarantees. However, the \"content\" is provided in the native formats developers are used to and the guarantees, where possible, are provided through other mechanisms.

It is also possible to run rebase-helper in non-interactive mode, however using it may provide only partial results mainly because some tasks simply need user interaction.  Rebase-helper is planned to be integrated with Fedora Upstream Release Monitoring. For every new package version, the rebase-helper will be run and a comment with the results will be added into the appropriate Bugzilla bug.
