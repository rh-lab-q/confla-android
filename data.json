Knowledge Is Everything - that\u2019s a slogan that lots of business domains is catching up right now. On the other hand, recent trends in software development are shifting into micro services environments where loosely coupled, standalone and independent services provide access to various business assets.  With that in mind, knowledge driven micro service idea came into live to combine couple of great technologies together to satisfy such needs: - vert.x - toolkit for building reactive applications on JVM - jBPM and Drools flexible process and rule engines that provide excellent execution environment for business assets - the knowledge - hazelcast - in memory data grid - various programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Scala, Groovy) to attract various development teams  This session is about illustrating how easily and fast you can build knowledge driven micro services and scale them to almost no limits. All in reactive and polyglot fashion with powerful clustering. Scale individual knowledge micro services without a hassle and allow various languages to easily interact with business knowledge without a need to know where they are located. It all goes via clustered event bus provided by Vert.x, backed by deployable knowledge archives provided by jBPM and Drools, clustering delivered by hazelcast data grid and allow polyglot client side access.  It\u2019s all about business knowledge that can be delivered as software solution with: - flexibility - speed of development - isolated scalability - manageability   Come and see how to transform your IT solutions into knowledge driven micro services with Vert.x, jBPM, Drools and Hazelcast. This session will be full of life demos to actually show the running micro services driven by business knowledge.","tags":["JUDCon, Microservices"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"e3e84a1e3e3398b5d174a5a4bc268655"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454665200,"event_start_rfc":"Fri, 05 Feb 2016 10:40:00 +0100","event_end":1454667600,"event_end_rfc":"Fri, 05 Feb 2016 11:20:00 +0100","room":"c.

What about running 'sudo yum update' on your cloud? This is a talk about the work we recently did on updates in TripleO. We start with an existing deployed OpenStack cloud, with 3 controller nodes in HA configuration and running tenant VMs. Each of the nodes that make up the cloud deployment need to be updated, without disruption to the tenants. Ultimately, the goal is that the cloud administrator, from a 'Director' node can do something like:  openstack overcloud update stack overcloud -i --templates ... params  This will update each node in sequence, bringing services down, updating packages and then bringing services back up again. For controller nodes in particular this is more complicated because we need to deal with the Pacemaker cluster, ensuring the wanted changes of the cluster configuration are in place for it to behave as expected during the update and also ensuring that the cloud services remain available.

Deciding what machine should host a certain VM is one of the important functions of the management platform. Unfortunately it is also one of the complex ones, because there can be many rules governing the placement policy and there is a time limit in which a VM has to be started or migration initiated.  All major projects today have a similar scheduling scheme where each VM is considered separately and that causes fragmentation of free resources. Both Nova scheduler and Kubernetes provide a set of filter and weight modules.  oVirt has a rich set of modules too but we are now allowing integration with a next generation algorithm set based on probabilistic (soft computing) methods thanks to the Optaplanner project.","tags":["Virtualization"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"193f8af7de912758c2829eed4d2d5671"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454748600,"event_start_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 09:50:00 +0100","event_end":1454751000,"event_end_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 10:30:00 +0100","room":"b.

Now that we have UEFI as a boot mechanism it's much more important to update firmware on devices, as these updates can fix serious security bugs. Periodically searching a vendor website for updates is a manual and error-prone task and not something we should ask users to do.  Providing a firmware update service actually requires two things:  * Vendors providing information about what updates are available for specific hardware * A mechanism to actually deploy the firmware onto the hardware itself  This presentation will outline the architecture used to deliver firmware updates in Fedora 23, right from the LVFS website for device OEMs to the high level GNOME integration. I'll cover the security model, the fallbacks and the different trade-offs we've had to made along the journey.  There will be time at the end for questions and comments.","tags":["Desktop"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"3a755a7c616cf883f398be1b4ccb641b"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454748600,"event_start_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 09:50:00 +0100","event_end":1454751000,"event_end_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 10:30:00 +0100","room":"a.

However, while working with microservice-based systems, it often appears that a practical mechanism that would provide help in shaping and describing REST contracts would come in handy.   Similarly, creating integration and acceptance tests in such systems presents many challenges. On one hand, we want to make the development and deployment of each service independent and agile, so we tend to use stubs, on the other hand, if we are not able to carry out proper E2E tests, we want to make sure that at any point in time, our stubs are in keeping with how are server actually responds to any given request.  In this talk, I will present Accurest, a tool that allows for both: easily shaping REST contracts and verifying if our app adheres to them. I will show how, using Accurest, we can quickly generate automatically-tested stubs from simple groovy DSL scripts. I will talk about the typical usages and script examples, as well as possible problems and ways of handling them.","tags":["Quality Assurance"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"99665f3e0310154e7e0654539f951af0"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454751600,"event_start_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 10:40:00 +0100","event_end":1454757000,"event_end_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 12:10:00 +0100","room":"workshops A112 (64 places)","room_short":"A112","room_color":"#ffff00","topic":"Identity-Management with FreeIPA (2nd part)","speakers":["Thorsten Scherf"],"description":"The workshop will give a general introduction into the FreeIPA framework and how it can be used to setup a central authentication solution based on OpenSource tools.

It builds on all kinds of infrastructure, from tailored desktop backends, to databases, to a JVM. Oh, and its third-party extensions do what they want, not what we expect.

A live migration keeps the guest running on the source host and begins moving the memory without stopping the guest. All modied memory pages are monitored for changes and sent to the destination while the image is sent. The memory is updated with the changed pages. The process continues until the amount of pause time allowed for the guest equals the predicted time for the nal few pages to be transferred. A problem with pre-copy live migration is that depending on the access pattern in the guest system, the migration pro- cess might be unable to reduce the number of dirty pages below the number necessary for the congured pause time to be met.

An OpenStack environment is challenging to debug as is -- more so when multiple Compute nodes and thereby multiple libvirt daemons and QEMU instances are involved. A good grasp of Virtualization debugging mechanisms is vital for effective root cause analysis. To that end, libvirt and QEMU provide a rich set of debugging controls that allow us to query (or modify) the state of virtual machines in distress.  This talk focuses on providing an in-depth view of aforementioned techniques.  Topics include: debugging Nova Compute process crashes; gathering specific patterns from libvirt log filters, libvirt environment variables, and systemd journal fields; live querying the VM (and QEMU) state through `virsh` and QEMU Machine Protocol (QMP) commands; tuning the libvirt daemon logging; monitoring events emitted by QEMU, etc. Along with a real-world example that ties together some of the techniques discussed.  Audience would include OpenStack infrastructure operators, Virtualization (libvirt\/QEMU\/KVM) administrators, developers, tinkerers, or any one interested in understanding the Virtualization layer in OpenStack to help equip yourself with better debugging techniques.","tags":["Virtualization"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"9d97206261f89fab9efb41ffcb019d46"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454775600,"event_start_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 17:20:00 +0100","event_end":1454778000,"event_end_rfc":"Sat, 06 Feb 2016 18:00:00 +0100","room":"b.

What challenges do a SDN present?  --Do popular open source systems like Snort or Bro scale when monitoring many virtual machiness?   --And what happens to the hypervisor's performance when an IDS is busy monitoring logs and traffic?  This talk will discuss current work that engages these questions. In this instance, the IDS is run on a separate machine than the hypervisor, so processing network traffic does not degrade performance.

Despite the fact that it has to follow Windows as the reference implementation of all these protocols, Samba was able to substantially raise the bar: Long before Microsoft announced SMB file server cluster with SMB 3.0 in late 2012, Samba created an all-active scale-out file server cluster when running on top of a distributed \/ clustered file system with the introduction of the CTDB software.  While CTDB is at its core a special purpose clustered database and messaging transport for Samba, it is also a slim little resource manager for virtual IPs and a few other services in the cluster.  This presentation describes the architecture of Samba and the history of the creation of CTDB. It demonstrates how easy one can set up a scale out Samba cluster on top of a distributed scale-out file system with the example of GlusterFS, and illustrates a few of the pleasantries that the SMB protocol brings with it in the clustered environment, such as fail over without aborting I\/O by virtue of durable\/persistent file handles.  Finally the current project to move towards a unified HA infrastructure for storage components is introduced.

It is very easy to work with such applications because they know exactly what we need them for and no more. In contrast there exist complex robust applications which can do everything we can think of but they are hard to learn, slow, not effective for our particular need, using too much resources, \"expensive\", and so on. Into this category we can put most of the business applications from big vendors which attract as many customers as possible and which need to fit to any business.  For many years, we have had flexible solutions (SOA, BPM, microservices, etc.) to keep business logic out of our applications. However, we did not have anything like that in the presentation layer and user interfaces of web applications until recently when web components emerged, html5 imports functionality was introduced, and lastly when Polymer 1.x became production ready in May 2015.  In this talk, we will get familiar with Polymer and its elements. To assemble a business application, we will create reusable custom BPM elements which will communicate to KIE Server working as a BPM back-end where we will keep all business processes, rules, forms, and other assets. Since we won't have to pay attention to the business logic, we will use the given time to focus on the user interface which end-users value the most. Like in any web application we will need routing, forms, data binding, signaling, asynchronous calls, calling REST services, hence there are many functionalities to discover.","tags":["Development"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"026813b09e0a607e870655e18844adf9"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454838000,"event_start_rfc":"Sun, 07 Feb 2016 10:40:00 +0100","event_end":1454840400,"event_end_rfc":"Sun, 07 Feb 2016 11:20:00 +0100","room":"d.

How do they get more relevant to the new power brokers?  Over the years, application and web developers have made it clear they are uninterested in packaging their applications if it requires them to do things beyond their normal languages and tool-chains. They are also not particularly interested in consuming their dependencies via distribution packaging tools if it requires a lag in availability, the developers packaging the libraries, and\/or learning the packaging software tools beyond the most rudimentary level. Developers have also made it clear that the way software is packaged, normally targeted at production installations, is very cumbersome when using it for development (e.g. the perennial 'setenforce 0').  Many people interpret the above as \"developers don't care about security or the trustworthiness of their dependencies.\" However, this is a mistake. Developers do not ever want to be the person listed as the problem when a major breach occurs. On the flip side, their \"bosses\" (actual bosses, software communities, professors, etc) set and enforce deadlines that do not allow for the time to muck about with things not directly related to their application development.   What can distributions do? Well, how about they stop providing a distribution. Instead, they can provide an operating system and a set of content. Where the \"things\" found in the operating system part are packaged in the traditional manner and provide all the traditional guarantees. However, the \"content\" is provided in the native formats developers are used to and the guarantees, where possible, are provided through other mechanisms.  This talk will discuss the work taking place in the Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat EL communities to address these challenges.","tags":["Fedora"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"90affc327d2c00abb5b114171aa33f62"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454847000,"event_start_rfc":"Sun, 07 Feb 2016 13:10:00 +0100","event_end":1454849400,"event_end_rfc":"Sun, 07 Feb 2016 13:50:00 +0100","room":"a.

It can assist with tasks that can not be automated, for example rebasing of downstream patches. Rebase-helper can perform multiple checks and inform the maintainer about possible issues caused by the rebase. It is also possible to run rebase-helper in non-interactive mode, however using it may provide only partial results mainly because some tasks simply need user interaction.  Rebase-helper is planned to be integrated with Fedora Upstream Release Monitoring. For every new package version, the rebase-helper will be run and a comment with the results will be added into the appropriate Bugzilla bug. For bugs without any activity for longer period of time, fedora-devel list and proven packagers should be notified, ideally only in case the rebase finished without any problems.","tags":["Fedora"],"location":"","lang":"EN","hash":"0969a954ef8e0fab8f525c4b50bfc4a5"},{"type":"Talk","event_start":1454853000,"event_start_rfc":"Sun, 07 Feb 2016 14:50:00 +0100","event_end":1454855400,"event_end_rfc":"Sun, 07 Feb 2016 15:30:00 +0100","room":"e.
